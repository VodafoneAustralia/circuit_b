Theory
======

When you are accessing some resource that is known to be unreliable,
it's better to wrap your requests with a circuit breaking logic.
The breaker acts as a fuse. When it senses that all your requests
end up with errors, it breaks the circuit and starts throwing fail-fast
errors instead without even trying to execute the code block in question.
Often it gives enough time for the resource (mail server, directory service,
router etc) to recover and resume normal operation.

After a certain period of time, circuit breaker attempts to restore
the link and, if it sees that the problem is still there, it breaks it
again.


Installation
============

	gem install circuit_b


Configuration
=============

	CircuitB.configure do |c|

		# Configure the storage that will be used to store the
		# state of the fuses across multiple invocations.
		# There are Memory- and Redis-based stores:
		#   - Memore store is good when you don't have
		#     several threads working with the same fuse,
		#     like in Rails or other multi-threaded environments.
		#   - Redis store is good for shared multi-threaded
		#     environments.
		c.state_storage = CircuitB::Storage::Redis.new

		# Configure the default fuse configuration that will be
		# used as the basis when you add your custom fuses. You
		# can specify only the parameters you want to override then.
		config.default_fuse_config = {
			:allowed_failures => 2,
			:cool_off_period  => 3	# seconds
		}

		# Adds a fuse named "mail" that is configured to tolerate
		# 5 failures before opening. After the cool off period
		# of 60 seconds it will close again. During the cool-off
		# time it will be raising FastFailure's without even
		# executing the code to protect the system from overload.
		c.add_fuse "mail", :allowed_failures => 5, :cool_off_period => 60

	end


Available storages
==================

In order to share the state between co-named fuses, one needs to use
the storage of the correct type. There are currently two storages for
the fuse state that you can use:

* _CircuitB::Storage::Memory_ -- the simplest memory-based storage.
	Ideal for the single-threaded situations.

* _CircuitB::Storage::Redis_ -- Redis-based storage. Well-suited
	for distributed setups (like multiple workers in Rails and alike)
	and acts like a simple IPC.


Usage
=====

Every time you want to protect a piece of code, you do this:

	CircuitB("mail") do
		# Attempting to send mail
	end

Note, that in order to use "mail" fuse you need to add it to your
configuration first (see above).

You can use fuses in any number of places, but since the state is
shared across all fuses with the same name, make sure you use them
for the same purpose, or better yet, refactor your code to have
it all in one place.


To Do
=====

* notifications and logging
* half-open state to open back faster if the problem still exists
* internal code block execution timeout support
* incrementing cool-off period on recurring errors (in half-open state)
* CouchDB storage
* Memcached storage
* passing storage configuration through the initializer
